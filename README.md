## README for Frequency Analysis and Correlation Analysis Project

### Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of frequency and correlation of various risk tags associated with smart contracts. The analysis is visualized using bar charts and heatmaps to provide clear insights into the data.

### Files in the Repository

1. **compiled_risk_data.xlsx**: This file contains the compiled data of risk tags used for the analysis.
2. **Frequency_analysis_share.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that includes the code for performing the frequency and correlation analysis on the risk tags.
3. **Frequency_Bar.png**: A PNG image that visualizes the frequency of each risk tag.
4. **Heatmap_Correlation_analysis.png**: A PNG image that shows the heatmap of the correlation analysis between different risk tags.
5. **Frequency_Correlation.docx**: A Word document that provides detailed descriptions and interpretations of the frequency and correlation analysis.
6. **Frequency_Correlation.pdf**: A PDF version of the document providing detailed descriptions and interpretations of the analysis.

### Instructions for Reproducing the Analysis

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
    - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    - Install the required libraries using the command:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
      ```

2. **Load the Data**:
    - Open the Jupyter Notebook `Frequency_analysis_share.ipynb`.
    - Load the `compiled_risk_data.xlsx` file into the notebook to access the data for analysis.

3. **Perform the Analysis**:
    - Run the cells in the notebook to perform the frequency and correlation analysis.
    - The notebook will generate the visualizations included in the repository.

4. **Review the Visualizations**:
    - The `Frequency_Bar.png` image provides a bar chart visualization of the frequency of each risk tag.
    - The `Heatmap_Correlation_analysis.png` image shows the heatmap of the correlation between different risk tags.

5. **Read the Detailed Analysis**:
    - Refer to `Frequency_Correlation.docx` or `Frequency_Correlation.pdf` for a detailed description and interpretation of the analysis.
